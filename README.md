# fix_variable_algorithm

This project was developed during a Master Degree in UFPI (Universidade Federal do Piaui).

Was developed a parallel algorithm as an alternative to the Fix Variable Method.

To parallelize the code was used OpenMP.

The original algorithm is based on the paper below.

Kiwiel, K.C. Variable fixing algorithms for the continuous quadratic knapsack problem, J. Optim. Theory Appl. 136 (3) (2008) 445â€“458
